<h1>MonopolyProject</h1>
This is a version of Monopoly<span>&#169</span> I created in my downtime to refine my Java programming skills. Note that trading, mortgaging, and upgrading property
is done via a KeyListener, and to access these menus, Alt_T, Alt_M, and Alt_U must be held accordingly. 
<br/><br/>There is a help menu that is advertised at the beginning of the program after registration (through Alt_H), but in case that isn't clear, this is just a reminder.
<br/><br/>Also, the image folder must be in the same directory as all the class files, with the images themselves in a subdirectory beneath said class files. If this is not done, the program will fail to find the images, and there will be a lot of white space.
<br/><br/>And finally, the program is based on a screen of size 1920x1080, so placement of frames and images is based on that. If you do not have this screen or larger, frames will appear off-screen and cause confusion.
<br/><br/>I hope you enjoy the game. I mean, it is Monopoly<span>&#169</span>, so that could hinder enjoyment lol
